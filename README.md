Semi-supervised:
-Applied supervised clustering and nearest shrunken centroids to solve classification of survival data (i.e no-class label gene data with only survival time and censoring status ).
-Modified the SPC( supervised principal components) and used the modified version to solve classification of the survival data.
-Developed a model that use MRMR (minimum-redundancy maximum-relevancy) feature selection and Bayesian classification to solve classification of the survival data 
-Explored which combination of feature selection(i.e .cox score for supervised clustering and SPL; MRMR) with classifier (i.e. nearest shrunken centroids; principal component; Bayesian classifier) is best for our survival data.
Unsupervised and supervised
-Implemented unsupervised clustering(e.g. hierarchical clustering) to solve classification of the survival data. 
-Applied KM (Kaplan Meier) graph or median cut to create class label and then adopted nearest shrunken centroids classifier.
-Planed to adopt GENN(Genetic Evolution Neural Network) to find gene-gene interaction.
